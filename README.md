# python-game-project
This contains the source code for a school project I was a part of with a partner. Feel free to try it out.

## Setup

### Windows
  This project contains the required python version install .msi and .exe for installing the pygame on windows. See the raw code for these files to download them and then run them. Once that is installed, download the code and double click the test.py executable to run the game.
### Linux
  If you pull this repo into a linux shell, you can run the game after the following commmands(need python 2.7 installed):
  
#### Get pygame if you don't already
    apt-get install python-pygame
  
pip install any other dependencies your system is missing.
  
#### Finally, do the following command to run it:
  `python test.py` 
  
ENJOY
